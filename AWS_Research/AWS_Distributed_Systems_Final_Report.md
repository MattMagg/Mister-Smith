## Architectural Patterns

### Supervisor Tree Pattern

```
Step Functions (Top Orchestrator)
    ├── ECS Service (Supervisor)
    │   ├── Task (Agent)
    │   ├── Task (Agent)
    │   └── Task (Agent)
    └── Lambda (Supervisor)
        ├── Invocation (Agent)
        └── Invocation (Agent)
```

Implementation using Step Functions as top-level orchestrator, ECS services as mid-level supervisors, and tasks/Lambda functions as worker agents. Each level provides fault isolation and automatic recovery.

### Event Sourcing & CQRS

```
Commands → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB (Event Store)
                                         ↓
                                  DynamoDB Streams
                                         ↓
                            EventBridge (Event Router)
                           ↙            ↓            ↘
                    Projection A   Projection B   Projection C
                    (Aurora)      (ElastiCache)  (OpenSearch)
```

Event sourcing with DynamoDB as the event store, Kinesis/DynamoDB Streams for event propagation, EventBridge for routing, and multiple read models using different databases optimized for query patterns.

### Actor Model Implementation

**Using Proto.Actor/Akka on EKS:**
```
Actor System (EKS Pod)
    ├── Supervisor Actor
    │   ├── Worker Actor → SQS Mailbox
    │   ├── Worker Actor → SQS Mailbox
    │   └── Worker Actor → SQS Mailbox
    └── Cluster Management
        └── Cloud Map Registration
```

Actors run as containers in EKS with:
- SQS FIFO queues as persistent mailboxes
- MemoryDB for actor state and location service
- EventBridge for external event integration
- Cloud Map for actor discovery

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

**Bedrock Multi-Agent Pattern:**
```
User Request
    ↓
Bedrock Supervisor Agent
    ├── Analysis Agent (Comprehend)
    ├── Vision Agent (Rekognition)
    ├── Search Agent (Kendra)
    └── Synthesis Agent (Claude)
         ↓
    Response Aggregation
```
