# Mister Smith

A multi-agent orchestration framework built with Rust, featuring NATS messaging, Claude integration, and supervision tree architecture for distributed AI agent coordination.

## Overview

Mister Smith is a foundational framework for building distributed agent systems using modern async Rust patterns. The system emphasizes fault tolerance, scalability, and clean separation of concerns through a supervision tree architecture.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Tokio Runtime**: Async foundation with configurable worker threads and resource management
- **Supervision Trees**: Hierarchical fault tolerance with automatic recovery and escalation
- **NATS Messaging**: High-performance pub/sub communication layer
- **Agent Orchestration**: Role-based agent spawning and coordination patterns
- **Security Framework**: JWT authentication, TLS, and secrets management

### Agent Types

The framework supports multiple specialized agent roles:

- **Supervisor**: Manages other agents and handles failures
- **Worker**: Performs computational tasks
- **Coordinator**: Orchestrates complex workflows
- **Monitor**: Observes system state and health
- **Planner**: Decomposes goals into executable tasks
- **Executor**: Carries out atomic actions
- **Critic**: Validates outcomes and provides feedback
- **Router**: Assigns tasks to appropriate agents
- **Memory**: Stores and retrieves knowledge

## Key Features

### Fault Tolerance
- Automatic agent restart with configurable policies
- Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation under load
- Health monitoring and failure detection

### Communication Patterns
- **Request-Response**: Synchronous agent communication
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Event-driven messaging
- **Queue Groups**: Load-balanced task distribution
- **Blackboard**: Shared knowledge coordination

### Resource Management
- Connection pooling for external services
- Memory-bounded context windows
- Adaptive resource allocation
- Backpressure handling

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Tokio 1.38 (async/await)
- **Messaging**: async-nats 0.34
- **HTTP**: Axum 0.8
- **gRPC**: Tonic 0.11
- **Security**: JWT, TLS 1.3
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging and metrics

## Documentation

The framework documentation is organized into several key areas:

### Core Architecture
- [System Architecture](ms-framework-docs/core-architecture/system-architecture.md) - Tokio runtime, async patterns, and supervision trees

### Data Management
- [Agent Orchestration](ms-framework-docs/data-management/agent-orchestration.md) - Agent types, coordination patterns, and lifecycle management
- [Data Persistence](ms-framework-docs/data-management/data-persistence.md) - Storage patterns and data management

### Transport Layer
- [Transport Specifications](ms-framework-docs/transport/transport-layer-specifications.md) - NATS messaging, communication patterns, and protocol definitions

### Security
- [Security Framework](ms-framework-docs/security/security-framework.md) - Authentication, authorization, TLS configuration, and secrets management

### Operations
- [Deployment Architecture](ms-framework-docs/operations/deployment-architecture-specifications.md) - Deployment patterns and infrastructure
- [Configuration Management](ms-framework-docs/operations/configuration-deployment-specifications.md) - Configuration and deployment specifications
- [Observability & Monitoring](ms-framework-docs/operations/observability-monitoring-framework.md) - Monitoring, logging, and observability patterns

## Design Principles

### Fail-Fast with Graceful Recovery
The system is designed to detect failures quickly and recover gracefully through supervision trees and circuit breakers.

### Event-Driven Architecture
Components communicate through events, enabling loose coupling and better scalability.

### Resource Efficiency
Async processing patterns and resource pooling ensure efficient use of system resources.

### Extensibility
Middleware patterns and plugin architectures allow for easy extension and customization.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

The framework explicitly avoids several common distributed systems anti-patterns:

- **Uncontrolled Agent Spawning**: Resource-bounded spawning prevents system exhaustion
- **Context Overflow**: Windowed context with summarization prevents memory issues
- **Synchronous Blocking**: All operations use async patterns to prevent thread blocking
- **Monolithic Supervision**: Hierarchical supervision distributes responsibility
- **Static Role Assignment**: Dynamic team composition based on task requirements

## Getting Started

> **Note**: This is a framework specification and documentation repository. Implementation details and setup instructions will be added as the system is developed.

The framework is designed to be:
- **Modular**: Components can be used independently
- **Configurable**: Extensive configuration options for different deployment scenarios
- **Observable**: Built-in monitoring and logging capabilities
- **Secure**: Security-first design with authentication and encryption
