- Response: Architecture review, potential redesign
- Escalation: Milestone 3 extension by 2-3 weeks

**Scenario 3: Security Vulnerability Discovery**
- Trigger: High/Critical security finding in audit
- Response: Immediate patch development, regression testing
- Escalation: Deployment delay until remediation verified
