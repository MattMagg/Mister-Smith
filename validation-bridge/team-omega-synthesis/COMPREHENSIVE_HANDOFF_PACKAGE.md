## Critical Gap Resolution Roadmap

### 6 Critical Gaps Confirmed
1. **Agent Orchestration Communication** (47% → 95%) - 8 weeks, HIGH priority
2. **Supervision Tree Implementation** (pseudocode → production) - 10 weeks, CRITICAL
3. **Kubernetes Pod Security Standards** (72% → 95%) - 6 weeks, CRITICAL
4. **PostgreSQL Migration Framework** (missing → complete) - 8 weeks, CRITICAL
5. **Neural Training Integration** (isolated → integrated) - 10 weeks, MEDIUM
6. **Security Protocol Standardization** (fragmented → unified) - 6 weeks, HIGH

### Implementation Priority
- **Phase 0 (Weeks 1-16)**: Critical gap resolution (parallel tracks)
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Foundation and critical path
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12)**: Core systems implementation
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 13-16)**: Integration and coordination
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 17-20)**: Operations and production readiness
- **Phase 5 (Weeks 21-24)**: Testing and deployment validation
