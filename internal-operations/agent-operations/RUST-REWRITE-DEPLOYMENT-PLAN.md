# Claude-Code-Flow Rust Rewrite: Multi-Agent Deployment Plan

## PLANNING AGENT MISSION

Create a comprehensive deployment plan for a claude-flow SPARC multi-agent swarm operation to investigate the Claude-Code-Flow repository and design a foundational Rust architecture that addresses identified pain points while preserving essential orchestration features.

## TASK SCOPE OVERVIEW

**Target Analysis:** Claude-Code-Flow repository investigation and Rust re-implementation design
**Primary Objective:** Create standards document combining system investigation and foundational Rust framework
**Resource Constraints:** Multi-agent swarm with appropriate coordination modes
**Success Criteria:** Evidence-driven standards document with minimal-viable architecture

## EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

### Part A: System Investigation

**Target Resource:** `claude-code-flow-clone/` repository

**Investigation Objectives:**

- Current architecture audit (agent pool, Spark/Swarm/batch modes, MCP layer, UI components)
- Specific fault identification with concrete evidence (file paths, commands, issues)
- Integration analysis (unified orchestrator vs. plugin model recommendations)
- Critical bug and anti-pattern detection blocking maintainability

**Evidence Requirements:** File paths, command examples, specific code issues, architectural diagrams

### Part B: Foundational Rust Framework

**Design Objectives:**

- Minimal-viable Rust architecture proposal fixing identified faults
- Execution model decision (embedded MCP vs. standalone binary)
- Rust library recommendations (async orchestration, CLI routing, tracing, web UI)
- Single entry point design (`flowctl` replacement for scattered scripts)
- Incremental roadmap (core → UI → MCP plugins)
- Explicit exclusions (postpone enterprise features)

**Deliverable:** Single standards document (Markdown/PDF) combining both parts

## PLANNING FRAMEWORK

**Methodology Reference:** Apply UltraThink methodology with systematic step-by-step verification (5-25 thoughts), comprehensive tool utilization, and structured workflow management.

## YOUR PLANNING RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. Task Complexity Analysis

**Evaluate and Document:**

- Scope and complexity of the Claude-Code-Flow repository analysis
- Volume and structure assessment of the codebase (20+ directories, 2500+ line files)
- Potential challenges in fault identification and evidence gathering
- Optimal workload distribution between investigation and design phases
- Time estimation for comprehensive analysis and architecture design

**Deliverable:** Complexity assessment report with resource recommendations

### 2. Agent Allocation Strategy

**Determine and Justify:**

- Optimal agent count (analyze 6-10 agent range for this specific task)
- Agent specialization requirements:
  - **Code Analysis Specialists** (repository investigation, fault detection)
  - **Architecture Design Specialists** (Rust framework design, library selection)
  - **Integration Specialists** (MCP analysis, execution model decisions)
  - **Documentation Specialists** (standards document creation, evidence compilation)
- Role distribution strategy for Part A investigation tasks
- Part B design team composition (recommend 2-3 agents for architecture consensus)
- Quality assurance agent allocation for validation

**Deliverable:** Agent allocation matrix with role specifications

### 3. Coordination Mode Selection

**Analyze and Select:**

- **Part A Investigation**: Distributed mode for parallel repository analysis
- **Part B Design**: Mesh mode for collaborative architecture design
- **Overall Coordination**: Hierarchical mode with investigation → design → validation phases
- Task interdependencies and collaboration requirements
- Communication and synchronization needs between investigation and design phases
- Handoff mechanisms between Part A and Part B

**Deliverable:** Coordination strategy document with mode justification
