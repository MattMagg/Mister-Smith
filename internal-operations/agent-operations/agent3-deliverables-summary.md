# Agent 3 Deliverables Summary

## Process Management & Message System Design

### Overview

Agent 3 has completed the design for MisterSmith's process management (`src/runtime/`) and message system (`src/message/` & `src/transport/`) components. The design focuses on minimal working implementation for Phase 2, with clear extension points for Phase 3 enhancements.

### Deliverables Completed

#### 1. Process Manager Design (`process-message-system-design.md`)

**Key Features:**
- Tokio-based process spawning and lifecycle management
- Hierarchical supervision with configurable restart policies
- Health monitoring with periodic checks
- Integration with message system for command/status communication
- Process states: Initializing → Idle → Busy → Paused → Error → Stopping → Terminated

**Core Components:**
- `ProcessManager`: Spawns and manages Claude CLI processes
- `Supervisor`: Monitors health and handles restarts
- `HealthMonitor`: Periodic health checks and heartbeats
- `ProcessConfig`: Configuration for spawn options and resource limits

#### 2. Message Routing System Design

**Key Features:**
- Base message envelope with standardized metadata
- Type-safe message definitions for agent communication
- Routing based on agent ID and message type
- Support for request-response and pub-sub patterns
- Priority-based message queuing

**Message Types:**
- `AgentCommand`: Commands for agent operations
- `AgentStatus`: Status updates and health reporting
- `TaskAssignment`: Task distribution to agents
- `TaskResult`: Results from executed tasks

#### 3. Transport Abstraction Design

**Key Features:**
- Generic `Transport` trait for protocol independence
- NATS implementation for Phase 2
- Connection pooling with health monitoring
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- Automatic failover between transports

**Transport Interface:**
```rust
pub trait Transport: Send + Sync {
    async fn connect(&mut self, config: ConnectionConfig) -> Result<(), TransportError>;
    async fn disconnect(&mut self) -> Result<(), TransportError>;
    async fn send(&self, message: Message) -> Result<Response, TransportError>;
    async fn subscribe(&self, topic: &str, handler: MessageHandler) -> Result<(), TransportError>;
    async fn health_check(&self) -> HealthStatus;
}
```

#### 4. Error Handling and Supervision Patterns

**Error Categories:**
- Process Errors: Spawn failures, crashes, resource limits
- Message Errors: Serialization, routing, validation, timeouts
- Transport Errors: Connection, disconnection, backpressure

**Supervision Patterns:**
- Restart policies: Never, Always, OnFailure, ExponentialBackoff
- Restart limits and windows
- Escalation handling for repeated failures
- Health aggregation across components

#### 5. Module Structure (`process-message-module-structure.md`)

**Detailed file organization for:**
```
src/runtime/          # Process management
├── process_manager.rs
├── supervisor.rs
├── health_monitor.rs
└── error.rs

src/message/          # Message system
├── envelope.rs
├── router.rs
├── dispatcher.rs
└── schemas/

src/transport/        # Transport abstraction
├── traits.rs
├── nats_transport.rs
├── connection_pool.rs
└── health_check.rs
```

### Implementation Examples (`process-message-implementation-examples.md`)

Provided working code examples for:
- ProcessManager with tokio process spawning
- MessageRouter with failover logic
- NatsTransport implementation
- Supervisor with exponential backoff
- Integration patterns between components

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Minimal Phase 2 Focus**: Design prioritizes working implementation over feature completeness
2. **Tokio Runtime**: Leverages tokio 1.38 for async process management
3. **NATS Messaging**: Uses async-nats 0.34 for reliable message transport
4. **Supervision Trees**: Simplified version of Erlang-style supervision
5. **Type Safety**: Strong typing for messages and errors

### Integration Points

1. **Process ↔ Message**: Processes receive commands and send status via messages
2. **Message ↔ Transport**: Messages routed through appropriate transport
3. **Supervision Integration**: All components report to unified supervisor

### Phase 3 Extension Points

The design includes clear extension points for:
- Advanced supervision patterns
- Resource limit enforcement via CGroups
- Message persistence with JetStream
- Multi-transport failover
- Distributed tracing integration
- Performance monitoring

### Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.38", features = ["full"] }
async-nats = "0.34"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
uuid = { version = "1.4", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
tracing = "0.1"
thiserror = "1.0"
async-trait = "0.1"
```

### Summary

The design provides a solid foundation for MisterSmith's process and message systems, balancing simplicity for Phase 2 implementation with extensibility for future enhancements. The modular structure ensures clean boundaries between components while the supervision patterns provide fault tolerance from day one.
