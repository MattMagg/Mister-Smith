# Claude-Code-Flow Rust Rewrite: Multi-Agent Deployment Plan

## PLANNING AGENT MISSION

Create a comprehensive deployment plan for a claude-flow SPARC multi-agent swarm operation to investigate the Claude-Code-Flow repository and design a foundational Rust architecture that addresses identified pain points while preserving essential orchestration features.

## TASK SCOPE OVERVIEW

**Target Analysis:** Claude-Code-Flow repository investigation and Rust re-implementation design
**Primary Objective:** Create standards document combining system investigation and foundational Rust framework
**Resource Constraints:** Multi-agent swarm with appropriate coordination modes
**Success Criteria:** Evidence-driven standards document with minimal-viable architecture

## EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

### Part A: System Investigation

**Target Resource:** `claude-code-flow-clone/` repository

**Investigation Objectives:**

- Current architecture audit (agent pool, Spark/Swarm/batch modes, MCP layer, UI components)
- Specific fault identification with concrete evidence (file paths, commands, issues)
- Integration analysis (unified orchestrator vs. plugin model recommendations)
- Critical bug and anti-pattern detection blocking maintainability

**Evidence Requirements:** File paths, command examples, specific code issues, architectural diagrams

### Part B: Foundational Rust Framework

**Design Objectives:**

- Minimal-viable Rust architecture proposal fixing identified faults
- Execution model decision (embedded MCP vs. standalone binary)
- Rust library recommendations (async orchestration, CLI routing, tracing, web UI)
- Single entry point design (`flowctl` replacement for scattered scripts)
- Incremental roadmap (core → UI → MCP plugins)
- Explicit exclusions (postpone enterprise features)

**Deliverable:** Single standards document (Markdown/PDF) combining both parts

## THREE-WAY COMPARISON OBJECTIVE

This operation performs a comprehensive three-way comparison to build toward the "Mister Smith" Rust swarm system:

### Comparison Framework
1. **Claude-Code-Flow** (Current Implementation)
   - Investigated by isolated agents to avoid bias
   - Focus on identifying faults, over-engineering, and pain points
   - Evidence-based analysis of what NOT to replicate

2. **Mister Smith Vision** (Target Architecture)
   - Documented in agent-documentation-framework
   - Represents consolidated, optimized agent orchestration system
   - Context gathered via basic-memory by design agents

3. **Optimal Rust Framework** (Synthesis)
   - Combines lessons from claude-flow investigation
   - Incorporates Mister Smith architectural principles
   - Results in minimal-viable foundation for implementation

### Strategic Goal
Create a solid framework to continue building agent documentation that will eventually implement the Rust swarm system ("Mister Smith") by learning from claude-code-flow's mistakes while preserving its essential orchestration capabilities.

## CONTEXT INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### Current State Reference System

**CRITICAL**: All agents (except isolated claude-flow investigators) must use basic-memory to gather context from the existing agent-documentation-framework work:

**Reference Directory:** `/Users/mac-main/Mister-Smith/Mister-Smith/agent-documentation-framework/`
- **Purpose**: Current state of the "Mister Smith" Rust swarm system vision
- **Usage**: READ-ONLY reference for comparison and framework understanding
- **Restriction**: Agents must NOT write to this directory

**Context Gathering Commands for Agents:**
```bash
# Architecture agents should query:
basic-memory query "agent-documentation-framework architecture patterns"
basic-memory query "RUST-SS consolidation coordination modes"
basic-memory query "SPARC modes consolidation results"

# Design agents should query:
basic-memory query "service architecture microservices"
basic-memory query "enterprise features integration patterns"
basic-memory query "optimization patterns performance"
```

### Output Directory Structure

**Target Location:** `/Users/mac-main/Mister-Smith/Mister-Smith/internal-operations/claude-flow-rust-migration-analysis/`

**Coordinator Responsibility:** Main orchestrator agent must:
1. Create appropriate folder structure in `claude-flow-rust-migration-analysis/`
2. Instruct agents on specific report locations
3. Organize findings by investigation phase and agent specialization

**Suggested Folder Structure:**
```
claude-flow-rust-migration-analysis/
├── investigation-reports/
│   ├── architecture-analysis/
│   ├── fault-identification/
│   ├── integration-analysis/
│   └── anti-pattern-catalog/

## SPECIFIC PAIN POINTS TO ADDRESS

Based on preliminary investigation, ensure agents focus on these confirmed issues:

### 1. Too Many Entry Points
- **Evidence**: 13+ binaries in `/bin/` directory
- **Impact**: User confusion, maintenance overhead
- **Files**: `bin/claude-flow*`, `cli.js`, `src/cli/main.ts`

### 2. UI Inconsistency
- **Evidence**: Multiple UI approaches (blessed, web, console, enhanced vs basic)
- **Impact**: Unclear interface selection for workflows
- **Files**: `src/ui/`, `src/cli/ui/`, web UI components

### 3. MCP Integration Collision
- **Evidence**: 20+ MCP files with complex tool registry, auth, load balancing
- **Impact**: Namespace clashes, configuration conflicts
- **Files**: `src/mcp/` directory, `mcp_config/`

### 4. Fragile Packaging
- **Evidence**: Complex build system (TypeScript, binary, Deno), multiple package.json
- **Impact**: Installation failures, build complexity
- **Files**: `package.json`, build scripts, temporary files in `/bin/`

### 5. Feature Bloat
- **Evidence**: Enterprise features, migration systems, advanced coordination
- **Impact**: Over-engineering relative to unstable core
- **Files**: `src/enterprise/`, `src/migration/`, complex orchestration

## RUST ARCHITECTURE FOCUS AREAS

Ensure design agents address these specific decisions:

### 1. Execution Model Decision
- **Option A**: Embedded MCP as primary transport layer
- **Option B**: Standalone Rust binary shelling out to claude-code CLI
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Maintainability, performance, integration complexity

### 2. Single Entry Point Design
- **Target**: Replace scattered scripts with unified `flowctl` command
- **Requirements**: Clear command hierarchy, consistent interface
- **Anti-Pattern**: Avoid current 13+ binary approach

### 3. Incremental Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Core orchestration (agent spawning, task management)
- **Phase 2**: Optional UI wrapper (single interface choice)
- **Phase 3**: Optional MCP plugins (clean integration)
- **Exclusions**: Enterprise features, advanced coordination, migration tools

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

- **Evidence-Based:** All fault identification must include concrete evidence
- **Minimal-Viable Focus:** Architecture design must prioritize maintainability over features
- **Clear Handoffs:** Smooth transition from investigation to design to documentation
- **Quality Validation:** Robust consensus mechanisms for architecture decisions
- **Actionable Output:** Standards document must be immediately usable for Rust development

**Remember:** You are designing the deployment strategy for investigating and redesigning Claude-Code-Flow, not implementing the Rust rewrite itself. Focus on optimal agent coordination for producing a high-quality standards document.
