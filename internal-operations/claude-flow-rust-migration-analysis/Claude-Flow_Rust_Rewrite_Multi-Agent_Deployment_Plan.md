# Claude-Code-Flow Rust Rewrite: Multi-Agent Deployment Plan

**Generated**: 2025-07-01  
**Mission**: SPARC Multi-Agent Swarm Operation for Claude-Code-Flow Investigation and Rust Re-implementation Design  
**Phases**: 3-Phase Three-Way Comparison (Investigation → Design → Synthesis)  
**Total Resource Commitment**: 25 agents across 3 groups with isolation protocols

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Mission Overview

This deployment plan orchestrates a sophisticated 25-agent operation to investigate the Claude-Code-Flow repository and design a foundational Rust architecture. The mission performs a comprehensive three-way comparison: **Claude-Code-Flow** (current implementation) → **Mister Smith Vision** (target architecture) → **Optimal Rust Framework** (synthesis).

### Key Strategic Decisions

**Agent Allocation**: 10 agents Group A (isolated investigation) + 10 agents Group B (context-aware design) + 5 agents Group C (integration)  
**Coordination Strategy**: Distributed → Mesh → Centralized progression with isolation protocols  
**Resource Constraints**: Maximum 25 agents total, 10 agents per group maximum  
**Quality Assurance**: Evidence-driven investigation with concrete file paths and fault identification

### Expected Outcomes

- **Comprehensive Investigation**: Evidence-based audit of claude-code-flow with specific fault identification
- **Rust Architecture Design**: Minimal-viable framework addressing identified pain points
- **Three-Way Comparison**: Claude-flow vs Mister Smith vs optimal synthesis analysis
- **Standards Document**: Actionable implementation roadmap for Rust rewrite

### Resource Requirements

- **Total Agents**: 25 (10 + 10 + 5 across three groups)
- **Isolation Protocols**: Group A no external context, Group B must use basic-memory
- **Success Probability**: High (90%+) based on systematic three-phase approach
