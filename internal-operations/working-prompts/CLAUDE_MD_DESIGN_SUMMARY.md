# MisterSmith CLAUDE.md Design Summary

## Overview

This design creates a comprehensive instruction system for the MisterSmith project that complements global anti-fabrication directives while addressing the unique challenges of building a multi-agent LLM orchestration framework incrementally.

## Design Artifacts Created

1. **Main Design Document** (`CLAUDE_MD_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md`)
   - Architecture overview with DDD principles
   - 4 bounded contexts defined
   - Comprehensive section outline
   - Implementation planning

2. **Bounded Context Map** (`CLAUDE_MD_BOUNDED_CONTEXTS.md`)
   - Project Reality Management Context
   - Anti-Pattern Prevention Context  
   - Incremental Development Control Context
   - LLM Integration Guidance Context
   - Inter-context communication patterns

3. **API Contract Specification** (`CLAUDE_MD_API_CONTRACT.md`)
   - Global-Project instruction interface
   - Phase Control API
   - Verification API
   - LLM Integration API
   - Event contracts and error handling

4. **Content Hierarchy Design** (`CLAUDE_MD_CONTENT_HIERARCHY.md`)
   - 9 major content blocks
   - Content patterns and templates
   - Information architecture principles
   - Style guide and metrics

5. **Evolution Strategy** (`CLAUDE_MD_EVOLUTION_STRATEGY.md`)
   - 4 lifecycle stages
   - Maintenance protocol
   - Evolution patterns
   - Metrics and monitoring
   - Risk management

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Foundation-First Philosophy

- Maximum constraints initially
- Evidence-based relaxation
- Reality over specification
- Incremental progression

### 2. Phase-Locked Development

- 4 phases: Foundation → Single Agent → Local Communication → Basic Orchestration
- Strict verification gates between phases
- No phase skipping allowed
- Feature budget per phase

### 3. Anti-Pattern Prevention

- Explicit forbidden behaviors
- Reality check questions
- Complexity traps documented
- Simple alternatives provided

### 4. Verification-First

- Every claim needs executable proof
- Commands over concepts
- Working code over documentation
- Concrete metrics for success

## Implementation Approach

The design treats CLAUDE.md as a living system that:

1. **Starts restrictive** to prevent common failures
2. **Evolves with evidence** from actual implementation
3. **Guides incrementally** through proven phases
4. **Maintains reality** by tracking what actually works

## Success Metrics

The instruction system succeeds when:

- Developers build working single agents before attempting distribution
- Anti-patterns are caught before implementation
- Phase progression happens smoothly with clear gates
- Instructions evolve based on real experience, not theory

## Next Steps

1. Implement the CLAUDE.md file based on this design
2. Set up evolution tracking tooling
3. Establish feedback mechanisms
4. Begin Phase 0 implementation with maximum constraints

## Remember

These instructions are designed to prevent the "ruv-FANN problem" - building complex theoretical systems that never actually work. By enforcing foundation-first development with verification at every step, MisterSmith can avoid the over-engineering trap that plagues many AI/LLM projects.
