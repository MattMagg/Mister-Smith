## Critical Gaps to Address in Implementation Plans

Based on Validation Bridge findings, implementation plans must specifically address:

### 6 Critical Gaps Requiring Detailed Implementation Plans
1. **Agent Orchestration Communication** (47% → 95%) - Agent-14
2. **Supervision Tree Implementation** (pseudocode → production) - Agent-04
3. **Kubernetes Pod Security Standards** (72% → 95%) - Agent-29
4. **PostgreSQL Migration Framework** (missing → complete) - Agent-15
5. **Neural Training Integration** (isolation → integrated) - Agent-36
6. **Security Protocol Standardization** (fragmented → unified) - Agent-17

### Implementation Planning Objectives
- Create step-by-step implementation guides with code examples
- Define dependency mapping and build order specifications
- Establish timeline and milestone documentation
- Provide resource allocation and team structure recommendations
- Include risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Define testing and validation checkpoints

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete implementation plans for all 7 major framework domains
- [ ] Step-by-step implementation guides with code examples
- [ ] Dependency mapping and build order specifications
- [ ] Timeline and milestone documentation
- [ ] Resource allocation and team structure recommendations
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Testing and validation checkpoints defined

## Execution Timeline
- **Batch Deployment**: Parallel execution across 5 batches
- **Expected Duration**: ~6 hours total
- **Coordination**: Master synthesis and documentation creation
- **Output**: Complete multi-document implementation planning suite
