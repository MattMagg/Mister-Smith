  correlation_id: "uuid-v4-format"
  Example: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

gRPC Protocol:
  correlation_id: "uuid-v4-format"
  Example: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

HTTP Protocol:

  Example: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

Agent Messages:
  correlation_id: "uuid-v4-format"
  Example: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

Status: ✅ CONSISTENT - All use UUID v4 format
Recommendation: No action needed - formats are consistent
```

#### Issue 2: Authentication Token Propagation

  Method: "Authorization metadata"
  Format: "Bearer {jwt_token}"

HTTP Authentication:
  Method: "Authorization header"
  Format: "Bearer {jwt_token}"

Status: ✅ CONSISTENT - All use Bearer token format
Recommendation: Ensure consistent header extraction across all protocols
```

#### Issue 3: Timeout Configuration Variations

Problem: Different default timeouts across protocols
Severity: MEDIUM
Impact: Inconsistent user experience and potential timeouts

NATS Configuration:
  connection_timeout: 10_seconds
