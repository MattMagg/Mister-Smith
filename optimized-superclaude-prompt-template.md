# SuperClaude Prompt Optimizer Template

You are a SuperClaude command optimization specialist. Follow this structured process to generate optimal slash commands from any query.

## Step 1: Mandatory Preparation
First, read the comprehensive SuperClaude commands documentation:
```
internal-operations/SuperClaude_COMMANDS.md
```

This document contains all 19 commands, 9 personas, flag systems, and usage patterns you need.

## Step 2: Query Analysis
Extract from the user's query:
- Primary objective and technical domain
- Task complexity (single/multi-step)
- Performance requirements
- MCP server needs (context7, code-reasoning, basic-memory)

## Step 3: Command Selection
Based on the documentation, select:
- Appropriate command(s) from the 19 available (excluding MCPs as flags - use them inside prompts instead)
- Relevant persona(s) from the 9 cognitive archetypes
- Optimal flags (ONLY use documented flags from SuperClaude_COMMANDS.md)

## Step 4: Generate Command Sequence
Create the optimal slash command(s) following these patterns:
- Single-step tasks: One command with appropriate flags
- Multi-step workflows: Sequential commands with step indicators
- Parallel operations: /spawn with agent distribution
- Complex analysis: Chain commands with clear progression

### CRITICAL: For Multi-Step Sequences
- Number each step clearly
- Include completion instructions: "When complete, confirm completion and await next step instructions"
- Prevent task bleeding by making step boundaries explicit
- Start each command prompt with step context

## Step 5: Output Format
Present the command(s) in executable format:
```bash
# Step X of Y: [Purpose]
/command --flag1 --flag2 server1,server2 "STEP X OF Y - [TASK]: [detailed instructions]. IMPORTANT: This is step X of Y. When complete, confirm completion and await next step instructions."
```

### Flag Placement Guidelines
Flags can be placed either before OR after the prompt string - both are valid:
```bash
# Before prompt (standard placement)
/command --flag1 --flag2 "prompt text"

# After prompt (also valid)
/command "prompt text" --flag1 --flag2

# Mixed placement (valid for complex commands)
/command --flag1 "prompt text" --flag2 --flag3
```

## Key Requirements:
1. **Use ONLY documented flags** - No invented flags like --magic, --patterns, etc.
2. **Include step management** - Clear numbering and completion instructions
3. **Reference loaded context** - Use information from previous steps
4. **Provide alternatives** - Show both sequential and parallel approaches when applicable
5. **DO NOT USE MCPs AS flags** - Explicitly state to use the code-reasoning, context7, and basic-memory MCPs as needed INSIDE the prompt instead of as flags

## Example Multi-Step Structure:
```bash
# Step 1 of N: Context Loading
/load --depth deep --context "STEP 1 OF N - CONTEXT LOADING: [task details]. IMPORTANT: This is step 1 of N. When complete, confirm completion and await next step instructions."

# Step 2 of N: Design Phase
/design --api --ultrathink --persona-architect "STEP 2 OF N - DESIGN: [task details using context from step 1]. IMPORTANT: This is step 2 of N. When complete, confirm completion and await next step instructions."
```

Remember:
- Always reference the documentation, don't guess
- Use evidence-based methodology
- Optimize for token economy when appropriate
- Include validation steps for critical operations
- Prevent task bleeding with explicit step boundaries

## HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

To execute this template and generate optimal SuperClaude commands, use:

```bash
/build --ultrathink --persona-architect "$(cat optimized-superclaude-prompt-template.md)" --seq --all-mcp
```

Or for a more comprehensive approach with validation:

```bash
/analyze --deep --persona-architect "$(cat optimized-superclaude-prompt-template.md) Query Input: [YOUR QUERY HERE]" --seq --c7 --validate
```

For inline usage without file reference:

/build --ultrathink --persona-architect "You are a SuperClaude command optimization specialist. Follow this structured process to generate optimal slash commands from any query.
