## Integration with Mister Smith Framework

The enhanced neural model directly addresses the framework's needs:

1. **Actor-based concurrency**: Neural networks optimized for actor message patterns
2. **Supervision trees**: Hierarchical error recovery built into quality gates
3. **Event-driven architecture**: Event correlation networks for real-time response
4. **Dual-store architecture**: Separate networks for cache vs persistent operations
5. **NATS messaging**: Optimized for subject-based routing and wildcards

## Continuous Learning Strategy

1. **Online Learning**: Update weights based on task outcomes
2. **Federated Learning**: Share learnings across agent instances
3. **A/B Testing**: Compare model versions in production
4. **Metric Tracking**: Continuous performance monitoring
5. **Adaptive Architecture**: Dynamic layer adjustment based on load

## Next Steps

1. Implement enhanced architecture in ruv-swarm
2. Create training datasets from MS framework patterns
3. Benchmark against current model
4. Deploy in phases with rollback capability
5. Monitor and iterate based on real-world performance

This configuration represents a significant advancement in neural model capability, specifically tailored for the multi-agent parallel workflows that the Mister Smith framework requires.
