### Document Reorganization

This document has been reorganized into focused sub-documents for improved agent readability and maintenance. The original 4755-line document has been segmented into:

1. **[Runtime and Errors](runtime-and-errors.md)** - Core error types and Tokio runtime architecture
2. **[Async Patterns](async-patterns-detailed.md)** - Task management, stream processing, and actor model
3. **[Supervision and Events](supervision-and-events.md)** - Supervision trees and event system
4. **[Monitoring and Health](monitoring-and-health.md)** - Health checks and metrics collection
5. **[Implementation Guidelines](implementation-guidelines.md)** - Patterns, anti-patterns, and best practices

## Overview

The Mister Smith AI Agent Framework is built on a robust, async-first architecture using Rust and Tokio. This system architecture provides:

- **Fault-tolerant agent orchestration** through supervision trees
- **High-performance async execution** with comprehensive error handling
- **Event-driven communication** for loose coupling
- **Resource-bounded operations** preventing system overload
- **Comprehensive monitoring** for production observability

## Core Components

### 1. Runtime and Error Management
- Comprehensive error taxonomy with automatic severity classification
- Recovery strategies for different error types
- Tokio-based async runtime with lifecycle management
- Graceful shutdown procedures

[→ Full Runtime and Errors Documentation](runtime-and-errors.md)

### 2. Async Patterns
- Task execution framework with priorities and retry policies
- Stream processing with backpressure handling
- Actor model implementation with mailboxes
- Agent-as-Tool pattern for composition
- Central tool registry with permissions

[→ Full Async Patterns Documentation](async-patterns-detailed.md)

### 3. Supervision and Events
- Hierarchical supervision trees for fault tolerance
- Multiple restart strategies (permanent, transient, temporary)
- Event bus for system-wide communication
- Event persistence and replay capabilities

[→ Full Supervision and Events Documentation](supervision-and-events.md)

### 4. Monitoring and Health
- Async health check system
- Component-specific health implementations
- Metrics collection with multiple types
- Backend integration support (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)

[→ Full Monitoring and Health Documentation](monitoring-and-health.md)

### 5. Implementation Guidelines
- Error handling best practices
- Critical anti-patterns to avoid
- Extension mechanisms (middleware, routing)
- Module organization structure
- Production readiness checklist

[→ Full Implementation Guidelines](implementation-guidelines.md)

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Async-First Design
All components are built on Tokio's async runtime, ensuring:
- Non-blocking I/O operations
- Efficient resource utilization
- Scalable concurrent operations
- Proper timeout and cancellation support

### 2. Fault Tolerance
The system is designed to handle failures gracefully:
- Supervision trees for automatic recovery
- Circuit breakers for external services
- Retry policies with exponential backoff
- Health monitoring for early detection

### 3. Resource Management
Preventing resource exhaustion through:
- Bounded agent spawning
- Connection pooling
- Memory-conscious context management
- Semaphore-based concurrency limits

### 4. Observability
Comprehensive monitoring capabilities:
- Structured logging with tracing
- Metrics collection and export
- Health check endpoints
- Event sourcing for audit trails

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- Error types and handling strategies
- Runtime management with Tokio
- Task execution framework
- Stream processing with backpressure
- Actor model with mailboxes
- Tool system with permissions
- Type system with strong typing

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- Supervision trees (concrete implementation provided, needs testing)
- Event system (implementation provided, needs integration)
- Health monitoring (basic implementation, needs production backends)

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented
- Resource pools
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Configuration management system
- Advanced middleware patterns

## Quick Start

```rust
use mister_smith_core::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), SystemError> {
    // Initialize runtime
    let config = RuntimeConfig::default();
    let mut runtime_manager = RuntimeManager::initialize(config)?;
    runtime_manager.start_system().await?;
    
    // Create actor system
    let actor_system = ActorSystem::new();
    
    // Create tool bus
    let tool_bus = ToolBus::new();
    
    // Your application logic here...
    
    // Graceful shutdown
    runtime_manager.graceful_shutdown().await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Cross-Domain Integration

The system architecture integrates with other framework domains:

- **[Data Management](../data-management)** - Persistent storage and vector operations
- **[Security Framework](../security)** - Authentication and authorization
- **[Transport Layer](../transport)** - NATS, gRPC, and HTTP communication
- **[Operations](../operations)** - Deployment and monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Review the [Runtime and Errors](runtime-and-errors.md) documentation for error handling patterns
2. Explore [Async Patterns](async-patterns-detailed.md) for task and actor implementations
3. Understand [Supervision and Events](supervision-and-events.md) for fault tolerance
4. Configure [Monitoring and Health](monitoring-and-health.md) for production observability
5. Follow [Implementation Guidelines](implementation-guidelines.md) for best practices
